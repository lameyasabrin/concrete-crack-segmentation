# Concrete Crack Segmentation

This repository implements a deep learning solution for segmenting cracks in concrete images using a Nested U-Net architecture. The model leverages custom loss functions and metrics to improve segmentation performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Mendeley Concrete Crack Image Segmentation** dataset. You can download the dataset from the following link:
